For this year’s show, we drew inspiration from Pittsburgh’s industrial history. In the 1980s, Pittsburgh experienced a massive transition out of its identity as an industrial city, forcing it to adapt and rebuild. Today, Pittsburgh demonstrates resilience by continuing to evolve with the times while honoring its roots.",

The year is 2268, and, on this 250th anniversary of the planet Earth’s quarantine, we present Ferox, a public demonstration of the hostility of the Earth’s previously dominant species, the homosapien. We invite Federation sponsors and visitors to observe, for the first time, the savagery we have successfully contained. Infused with Federation principles, the previously dangerous human race is now docile - an allegory for the potential of the IFPP to mollify threatening agents intergalactically. Come celebrate with us! And, in the process, bear witness to a species, that, prior to this event, has been contained for centuries.",
